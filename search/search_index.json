It composes Variable containers and/or View Models, a helper plugin manager for helpers , and optional filtering of the captured output. The PhpRenderer is template-system agnostic; you may use PHP as your template language, or create instances of other template systems and manipulate them within your view script. Anything you can do with PHP is available to you. Usage Basic usage consists of instantiating or otherwise obtaining an instance of the PhpRenderer , providing it with a resolver which will resolve templates to PHP view scripts, and then calling its render() method. Instantiating a renderer: use Laminas\\View\\Renderer\\PhpRenderer; $renderer = new PhpRenderer(); laminas-view ships with several types of \"resolvers\", which are used to resolve a template name to a resource a renderer can consume. The ones we will usually use with the PhpRenderer are: Laminas\\View\\Resolver\\TemplateMapResolver , which simply maps template names directly to view scripts. Laminas\\View\\Resolver\\TemplatePathStack , which creates a LIFO stack of script directories in which to search for a view script. By default, it appends the suffix .phtml to the requested template name, and then loops through the script directories; if it finds a file matching the requested template, it returns the full file path. Laminas\\View\\Resolver\\RelativeFallbackResolver , which allows using short template name into partial rendering. It is used as wrapper for each of two aforesaid resolvers. For example, this allows usage of partial template paths such as my/module/script/path/my-view/some/partial.phtml , while rendering template my/module/script/path/my-view by short name some/partial . Laminas\\View\\Resolver\\AggregateResolver , which allows attaching a FIFO queue of resolvers to consult. We suggest using the AggregateResolver , as it allows you to create a multi-tiered strategy for resolving template names. Programmatically, you would then do something like this: use Laminas\\View\\Renderer\\PhpRenderer; use Laminas\\View\\Resolver; $renderer = new PhpRenderer(); $resolver = new Resolver\\AggregateResolver(); $renderer-&gt;setResolver($resolver); $map = new Resolver\\TemplateMapResolver([ 'layout' =&gt; __DIR__ . '/view/layout.phtml', 'index/index' =&gt; __DIR__ . '/view/index/index.phtml', ]); $stack = new Resolver\\TemplatePathStack([ 'script_paths' =&gt; [ __DIR__ . '/view', $someOtherPath ], ]); // Attach resolvers to the aggregate: $resolver -&gt;attach($map) // this will be consulted first, and is the fastest lookup -&gt;attach($stack) // filesystem-based lookup -&gt;attach(new Resolver\\RelativeFallbackResolver($map)) // allow short template names -&gt;attach(new Resolver\\RelativeFallbackResolver($stack)); You can also specify a specific priority value when registering resolvers, with high, positive integers getting higher priority, and low, negative integers getting low priority, when resolving. If you are started your application via the laminas-mvc-skeleton , you can provide the above via configuration: // In the Application module configuration // (module/Application/config/module.config.php): return [ 'view_manager' =&gt; [ 'template_map' =&gt; [ 'layout' =&gt; __DIR__ . '/../view/layout.phtml', 'index/index' =&gt; __DIR__ . '/../view/index/index.phtml', ], 'template_path_stack' =&gt; [ 'application' =&gt; __DIR__ . '/../view', ], ], ]; If you did not begin with the skeleton application, you will need to write your own factories for creating each resolver and wiring them to the AggregateResolver and injecting into the PhpRenderer . Now that we have our PhpRenderer instance, and it can find templates, let's inject some variables. This can be done in 4 different ways. Pass an associative array (or ArrayAccess instance, or Laminas\\View\\Variables instance) of items as the second argument to render() : $renderer-&gt;render($templateName, ['foo' =&gt; 'bar']) Assign a Laminas\\View\\Variables instance, associative array, or ArrayAccess instance to the setVars() method. Assign variables as instance properties of the renderer: $renderer-&gt;foo = 'bar' . This essentially proxies to an instance of Variables composed internally in the renderer by default. Create a ViewModel instance, assign variables to that, and pass the ViewModel to the render() method: As an example of the latter: use Laminas\\View\\Model\\ViewModel; use Laminas\\View\\Renderer\\PhpRenderer; $renderer = new PhpRenderer(); $model = new ViewModel(); $model-&gt;setVariable('foo', 'bar'); // or $model = new ViewModel(['foo' =&gt; 'bar']); $model-&gt;setTemplate($templateName); $renderer-&gt;render($model); Now, let's render something. As an example, let us say you have a list of book data. // use a model to get the data for book authors and titles. $data = [ [ 'author' =&gt; 'Hernando de Soto', 'title' =&gt; 'The Mystery of Capitalism', ], [ 'author' =&gt; 'Henry Hazlitt', 'title' =&gt; 'Economics in One Lesson', ], [ 'author' =&gt; 'Milton Friedman', 'title' =&gt; 'Free to Choose', ], ]; // now assign the book data to a renderer instance $renderer-&gt;books = $data; // and render the template \"booklist\" echo $renderer-&gt;render('booklist'); More often than not, you'll likely be using the MVC layer. As such, you should be thinking in terms of view models. Let's consider the following code from within an action method of a controller. namespace Bookstore\\Controller; use Laminas\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController; class BookController extends AbstractActionController { public function listAction() { // do some work... // Assume $data is the list of books from the previous example $model = new ViewModel(['books' =&gt; $data]); // Optionally specify a template; if we don't, by default it will be // auto-determined based on the module name, controller name and this action. // In this example, the template would resolve to \"bookstore/book/list\", // and thus the file \"bookstore/book/list.phtml\"; the following overrides // that to set the template to \"booklist\", and thus the file \"booklist.phtml\" // (note the lack of directory preceding the filename). $model-&gt;setTemplate('booklist'); return $model } } This will then be rendered as if the following were executed: $renderer-&gt;render($model); Now we need the associated view script. At this point, we'll assume that the template booklist resolves to the file booklist.phtml . This is a PHP script like any other, with one exception: it executes inside the scope of the PhpRenderer instance, which means that references to $this point to the PhpRenderer instance properties and methods. Thus, a very basic view script could look like this: &lt;?php if ($this-&gt;books): ?&gt; &lt;!-- A table of some books. --&gt; &lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Author&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Title&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;?php foreach ($this-&gt;books as $key =&gt; $val): ?&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;?= $this-&gt;escapeHtml($val['author']) ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;?= $this-&gt;escapeHtml($val['title']) ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;?php else: ?&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are no books to display.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;?php endif;?&gt; Escape Output The security mantra is \"Filter input, escape output.\" If you are unsure of the source of a given variable — which is likely most of the time — you should escape it based on which HTML context it is being injected into. The primary contexts to be aware of are HTML Body, HTML Attribute, Javascript, CSS and URI. Each context has a dedicated helper available to apply the escaping strategy most appropriate to each context. You should be aware that escaping does vary significantly between contexts; there is no one single escaping strategy that can be globally applied. In the example above, there are calls to an escapeHtml() method. The method is actually a helper , a plugin available via method overloading. Additional escape helpers provide the escapeHtmlAttr() , escapeJs() , escapeCss() , and escapeUrl() methods for each of the HTML contexts you are most likely to encounter. By using the provided helpers and being aware of your variables' contexts, you will prevent your templates from running afoul of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. We've now toured the basic usage of the PhpRenderer . By now you should know how to instantiate the renderer, provide it with a resolver, assign variables and/or create view models, create view scripts, and render view scripts. Options and Configuration Laminas\\View\\Renderer\\PhpRenderer utilizes several collaborators in order to do its work. Use the following methods to configure the renderer. Unless otherwise noted, class names are relative to the Laminas\\View namespace. setHelperPluginManager setHelperPluginManager(string|HelperPluginManager $helpers): void Set the helper plugin manager instance used to load, register, and retrieve helpers . setResolver setResolver(Resolver\\\\ResolverInterface $resolver) : void Set the resolver instance. setFilterChain setFilterChain(\\Laminas\\Filter\\FilterChain $filters) : void Set a filter chain to use as an output filter on rendered content. setVars setVars(array|\\ArrayAccess|Variables $variables) : void Set the variables to use when rendering a view script/template. setCanRenderTrees setCanRenderTrees(boolean $canRenderTrees) : void Set the flag indicating whether or not we should render trees of view models. If set to true, the Laminas\\View\\View instance will not attempt to render children separately, but instead pass the root view model directly to the PhpRenderer . It is then up to the developer to render the children from within the view script. This is typically done using the RenderChildModel helper: $this-&gt;renderChildModel('child_name') . Additional Methods Typically, you'll only ever access variables and helpers within your view scripts or when interacting with the PhpRenderer . However, there are a few additional methods you may be interested in. Unless otherwise noted, class names are relative to the Laminas\\View namespace. render render( string|Model\\ModelInterface $nameOrModel, array|\\Traversable $values = null ) : string Render a template/view model. If $nameOrModel is a string, it is assumed to be a template name. That template will be resolved using the current resolver, and then rendered. If $values is non-null, those values, and those values only, will be used during rendering, and will replace whatever variable container previously was in the renderer; however, the previous variable container will be reset when done. If $values is empty, the current variables container (see setVars() ) will be injected when rendering. If $nameOrModel is a ModelInterface instance, the template name will be retrieved from it and used. Additionally, if the model contains any variables, these will be used when rendering; otherwise, the variables container already present, if any, will be used. The method returns the script output. resolver resolver() : Resolver\\ResolverInterface Retrieves the current Resolver instance. vars vars(string $key = null) : mixed Retrieve a single variable from the container if a key is provided; otherwise it will return the variables container. plugin plugin(string $name, array $options = null) : Helper\\HelperInterface Retrieve a plugin/helper instance. Proxies to the plugin manager's get() method; as such, any $options you pass will be passed to the plugin's constructor if this is the first time the plugin has been retrieved. See the section on helpers for more information. addTemplate addTemplate(string $template) : void Add a template to the stack. When used, the next call to render() will loop through all templates added using this method, rendering them one by one; the output of the last will be returned.","title":"The PhpRenderer"},{"location":"php-renderer/#the-phprenderer","text":"Laminas\\View\\Renderer\\PhpRenderer \"renders\" view scripts written in PHP, capturing and returning the output.

It is a multi-tiered system allowing a variety of mechanisms for extension, substitution, and more. The components of the view layer are as follows: Variables Containers hold variables and callbacks that you wish to represent in the view. Often-times, a Variables Container will also provide mechanisms for context-specific escaping of variables and more. View Models hold Variables Containers, specify the template to use (if any), and optionally provide rendering options (more on that below). View Models may be nested in order to represent complex structures. Renderers take View Models and provide a representation of them to return. laminas-view ships with three renderers by default: a PhpRenderer which utilizes PHP templates in order to generate markup, a JsonRenderer , and a FeedRenderer for generating RSS and Atom feeds. Resolvers utilize Resolver Strategies to resolve a template name to a resource a Renderer may consume. As an example, a Resolver may take the name \"blog/entry\" and resolve it to a PHP view script. The View consists of strategies that map the current Request to a Renderer, and strategies for injecting the result of rendering to the Response. Rendering Strategies listen to the Laminas\\View\\ViewEvent::EVENT_RENDERER event of the View and decide which Renderer should be selected based on the Request or other criteria. Response Strategies are used to inject the Response object with the results of rendering. That may also include taking actions such as setting Content-Type headers. Additionally, laminas-mvc integrates with laminas-view via a number of event listeners in the Laminas\\Mvc\\View namespace. This section of the manual is designed to show you typical usage patterns of the view layer when using it with laminas-mvc . The assumption is that you are using the service manager and the default MVC view strategies. Configuration The default configuration will typically work out-of-the-box. However, you will still need to select Resolver Strategies and configure them, as well as potentially indicate alternate template names for things like the site layout, 404 (not found) pages, and error pages. The code snippets below can be added to your configuration to accomplish this. We recommend adding it to a site-specific module, such as the \"Application\" module from the framework's laminas-mvc-skeleton , or to one of your autoloaded configurations within the config/autoload/ directory. return [ 'view_manager' =&gt; [ // The TemplateMapResolver allows you to directly map template names // to specific templates. The following map would provide locations // for a home page template (\"application/index/index\"), as well as for // the layout (\"layout/layout\"), error pages (\"error/index\"), and // 404 page (\"error/404\"), resolving them to view scripts. 'template_map' =&gt; [ 'application/index/index' =&gt; __DIR__ . '/../view/application/index/index.phtml', 'site/layout' =&gt; __DIR__ . '/../view/layout/layout.phtml', 'error/index' =&gt; __DIR__ . '/../view/error/index.phtml', 'error/404' =&gt; __DIR__ . '/../view/error/404.phtml', ], // The TemplatePathStack takes an array of directories. Directories // are then searched in LIFO order (it's a stack) for the requested // view script. This is a nice solution for rapid application // development, but potentially introduces performance expense in // production due to the number of static calls necessary. // // The following adds an entry pointing to the view directory // of the current module. Make sure your keys differ between modules // to ensure that they are not overwritten -- or simply omit the key! 'template_path_stack' =&gt; [ 'application' =&gt; __DIR__ . '/../view', ], // This will be used as the default suffix for template scripts // resolving, it defaults to 'phtml'. 'default_template_suffix' =&gt; 'php', // Set the template name for the site's layout. // // By default, the MVC's default Rendering Strategy uses the // template name \"layout/layout\" for the site's layout. // Here, we tell it to use the \"site/layout\" template, // which we mapped via the TemplateMapResolver above. 'layout' =&gt; 'site/layout', // By default, the MVC registers an \"exception strategy\", which is // triggered when a requested action raises an exception; it creates // a custom view model that wraps the exception, and selects a // template. We'll set it to \"error/index\". // // Additionally, we'll tell it that we want to display an exception // stack trace; you'll likely want to disable this by default. 'display_exceptions' =&gt; true, 'exception_template' =&gt; 'error/index', // Another strategy the MVC registers by default is a \"route not // found\" strategy. Basically, this gets triggered if (a) no route // matches the current request, (b) the controller specified in the // route match cannot be found in the service locator, (c) the controller // specified in the route match does not implement the DispatchableInterface // interface, or (d) if a response from a controller sets the // response status to 404. // // The default template used in such situations is \"error\", just // like the exception strategy. Here, we tell it to use the \"error/404\" // template (which we mapped via the TemplateMapResolver, above). // // You can opt in to inject the reason for a 404 situation; see the // various `Application\\:\\:ERROR_*`_ constants for a list of values. // Additionally, a number of 404 situations derive from exceptions // raised during routing or dispatching. You can opt-in to display // these. 'display_not_found_reason' =&gt; true, 'not_found_template' =&gt; 'error/404', ], ]; Controllers and View Models Laminas\\View\\View consumes ViewModel s, passing them to the selected renderer. Where do you create these, though? The most explicit way is to create them in your controllers and return them. namespace Foo\\Controller; use Laminas\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController; use Laminas\\View\\Model\\ViewModel; class BazBatController extends AbstractActionController { public function doSomethingCrazyAction() { $view = new ViewModel([ 'message' =&gt; 'Hello world', ]); $view-&gt;setTemplate('foo/baz-bat/do-something-crazy'); return $view; } } This sets a \"message\" variable in the View Model, and sets the template name \"foo/baz-bat/do-something-crazy\". The View Model is then returned. In most cases, you'll likely have a template name based on the module namespace, controller, and action. Considering that, and if you're simply passing some variables, could this be made simpler? Definitely. The MVC registers a couple of listeners for controllers to automate this. The first will look to see if you returned an associative array from your controller; if so, it will create a View Model and make this associative array the Variables Container; this View Model then replaces the MvcEvent 's result. It will also look to see if you returned nothing or null ; if so, it will create a View Model without any variables attached; this View Model also replaces the MvcEvent 's result. The second listener checks to see if the MvcEvent result is a View Model, and, if so, if it has a template associated with it. If not, it will inspect the controller matched during routing to determine the module namespace and the controller class name, and, if available, it's \"action\" parameter in order to create a template name. This will be module/controller/action , all normalized to lowercase, dash-separated words. As an example, the controller Foo\\Controller\\BazBatController with action \"doSomethingCrazyAction\", would be mapped to the template foo/baz-bat/do-something-crazy . As you can see, the words \"Controller\" and \"Action\" are omitted. In practice, that means our previous example could be re-written as follows: namespace Foo\\Controller; use Laminas\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController; class BazBatController extends AbstractActionController { public function doSomethingCrazyAction() { return [ 'message' =&gt; 'Hello world', ]; } } The above method will likely work for the majority of use cases. When you need to specify a different template, explicitly create and return a View Model and specify the template manually, as in the first example. Nesting View Models The other use case you may have for setting explicit View Models is if you wish to nest them. In other words, you might want to render templates to be included within the main View you return. As an example, you may want the View from an action to be one primary section that includes both an \"article\" and a couple of sidebars; one of the sidebars may include content from multiple Views as well: namespace Content\\Controller; use Laminas\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController; use Laminas\\View\\Model\\ViewModel; class ArticleController extends AbstractActionController { public function viewAction() { // get the article from the persistence layer, etc... $view = new ViewModel(); // this is not needed since it matches \"module/controller/action\" $view-&gt;setTemplate('content/article/view'); $articleView = new ViewModel(['article' =&gt; $article]); $articleView-&gt;setTemplate('content/article'); $primarySidebarView = new ViewModel(); $primarySidebarView-&gt;setTemplate('content/main-sidebar'); $secondarySidebarView = new ViewModel(); $secondarySidebarView-&gt;setTemplate('content/secondary-sidebar'); $sidebarBlockView = new ViewModel(); $sidebarBlockView-&gt;setTemplate('content/block'); $secondarySidebarView-&gt;addChild($sidebarBlockView, 'block'); $view-&gt;addChild($articleView, 'article') -&gt;addChild($primarySidebarView, 'sidebar_primary') -&gt;addChild($secondarySidebarView, 'sidebar_secondary'); return $view; } } The above will create and return a View Model specifying the template content/article/view . When the View is rendered, it will render three child Views, the $articleView , $primarySidebarView , and $secondarySidebarView ; these will be captured to the $view 's article , sidebar_primary , and sidebar_secondary variables, respectively, so that when it renders, you may include that content. Additionally, the $secondarySidebarView will include an additional View Model, $sidebarBlockView , which will be captured to its block view variable. To better visualize this, let's look at what the final content might look like, with comments detailing where each nested view model is injected. Here are the templates, rendered based on a 12-column grid. The content/article/view template: &lt;!-- This is from the $view View Model, and the \"content/article/view\" template --&gt; &lt;div class=\"row content\"&gt; &lt;?= $this-&gt;article ?&gt; &lt;?= $this-&gt;sidebar_primary ?&gt; &lt;?= $this-&gt;sidebar_secondary ?&gt; &lt;/div&gt; The content/article template: &lt;!-- This is from the $articleView View Model, and the \"content/article\" template --&gt; &lt;article class=\"span8\"&gt; &lt;?= $this-&gt;escapeHtml('article') ?&gt; &lt;/article&gt; The content/main-sidebar template: &lt;!-- This is from the $primarySidebarView View Model, and the \"content/main-sidebar\" template --&gt; &lt;div class=\"span2 sidebar\"&gt; sidebar content... &lt;/div&gt; The content/secondary-sidebar template: &lt;!-- This is from the $secondarySidebarView View Model, and the \"content/secondary-sidebar\" template --&gt; &lt;div class=\"span2 sidebar pull-right\"&gt; &lt;?= $this-&gt;block ?&gt; &lt;/div&gt; The content/block template: &lt;!-- This is from the $sidebarBlockView View Model, and the \"content/block\" template --&gt; &lt;div class=\"block\"&gt; block content... &lt;/div&gt; And here is the aggregate, generated content: &lt;!-- This is from the $view View Model, and the \"content/article/view\" template --&gt; &lt;div class=\"row content\"&gt; &lt;!-- This is from the $articleView View Model, and the \"content/article\" template --&gt; &lt;article class=\"span8\"&gt; Lorem ipsum .... &lt;/article&gt; &lt;!-- This is from the $primarySidebarView View Model, and the \"content/main-sidebar\" template --&gt; &lt;div class=\"span2 sidebar\"&gt; sidebar content... &lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- This is from the $secondarySidebarView View Model, and the \"content/secondary-sidebar\" template --&gt; &lt;div class=\"span2 sidebar pull-right\"&gt; &lt;!-- This is from the $sidebarBlockView View Model, and the \"content/block\" template --&gt; &lt;div class=\"block\"&gt; block content... &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; You can achieve very complex markup using nested Views, while simultaneously keeping the details of rendering isolated from the Request/Response lifecycle of the controller. Dealing with Layouts Most sites enforce a cohesive look-and-feel which we typically call the site's \"layout\". It includes the default stylesheets and JavaScript necessary, if any, as well as the basic markup structure into which all site content will be injected. Within laminas-mvc, layouts are handled via nesting of View Models ( see the previous example for examples of View Model nesting). The Laminas\\Mvc\\View\\Http\\ViewManager composes a View Model which acts as the \"root\" for nested View Models. As such, it should contain the skeleton (or layout) template for the site. All other content is then rendered and captured to view variables of this root View Model. The ViewManager sets the layout template as layout/layout by default. To change this, you can add some configuration to the view_manager area of your configuration . A listener on the controllers, Laminas\\Mvc\\View\\Http\\InjectViewModelListener , will take a View Model returned from a controller and inject it as a child of the root (layout) View Model. By default, View Models will capture to the \"content\" variable of the root View Model. This means you can do the following in your layout view script: &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;&lt;?= $this-&gt;headTitle() ?&gt;&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;?= $this-&gt;content; ?&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; If you want to specify a different View variable for which to capture, explicitly create a view model in your controller, and set its \"capture to\" value: namespace Foo\\Controller; use Laminas\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController; use Laminas\\View\\Model\\ViewModel; class BazBatController extends AbstractActionController { public function doSomethingCrazyAction() { $view = new ViewModel([ 'message' =&gt; 'Hello world', ]); // Capture to the layout view's \"article\" variable $view-&gt;setCaptureTo('article'); return $view; } } There will be times you don't want to render a layout. For example, you might be answering an API call which expects JSON or an XML payload, or you might be answering an XHR request that expects a partial HTML payload. To do this, explicitly create and return a view model from your controller, and mark it as \"terminal\", which will hint to the MVC listener that normally injects the returned View Model into the layout View Model, to instead replace the layout view model. namespace Foo\\Controller; use Laminas\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController; use Laminas\\View\\Model\\ViewModel; class BazBatController extends AbstractActionController { public function doSomethingCrazyAction() { $view = new ViewModel([ 'message' =&gt; 'Hello world', ]); // Disable layouts; `MvcEvent` will use this View Model instead $view-&gt;setTerminal(true); return $view; } } When discussing nesting View Models , we detailed a nested View Model which contained an article and sidebars. Sometimes, you may want to provide additional View Models to the layout, instead of nesting in the returned layout. This may be done by using the layout() controller plugin, which returns the root View Model. You can then call the same addChild() method on it as we did in that previous example. namespace Content\\Controller; use Laminas\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController; use Laminas\\View\\Model\\ViewModel; class ArticleController extends AbstractActionController { public function viewAction() { // get the article from the persistence layer, etc... // Get the \"layout\" view model and inject a sidebar $layout = $this-&gt;layout(); $sidebarView = new ViewModel(); $sidebarView-&gt;setTemplate('content/sidebar'); $layout-&gt;addChild($sidebarView, 'sidebar'); // Create and return a view model for the retrieved article $view = new ViewModel(['article' =&gt; $article]); $view-&gt;setTemplate('content/article'); return $view; } } You could also use this technique to select a different layout, by calling the setTemplate() method of the layout View Model: //In a controller namespace Content\\Controller; use Laminas\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController; use Laminas\\View\\Model\\ViewModel; class ArticleController extends AbstractActionController { public function viewAction() { // get the article from the persistence layer, etc... // Get the \"layout\" view model and set an alternate template $layout = $this-&gt;layout(); $layout-&gt;setTemplate('article/layout'); // Create and return a view model for the retrieved article $view = new ViewModel(['article' =&gt; $article]); $view-&gt;setTemplate('content/article'); return $view; } } Sometimes, you may want to access the layout from within your actual view scripts when using the PhpRenderer . Reasons might include wanting to change the layout template, or wanting to either access or inject layout view variables. Similar to the layout() controller plugin, you can use the layout() View Helper. If you provide a string argument to it, you will change the template; if you provide no arguments, the root layout View Model is returned. //In a view script // Change the layout: $this-&gt;layout('alternate/layout'); // OR $this-&gt;layout()-&gt;setTemplate('alternate/layout'); // Access a layout variable. // Since access to the base view model is relatively easy, it becomes a // reasonable place to store things such as API keys, which other view scripts // may need. $layout = $this-&gt;layout(); $disqusApiKey = false; if (isset($layout-&gt;disqusApiKey)) { $disqusApiKey = $layout-&gt;disqusApiKey; } // Set a layout variable $this-&gt;layout()-&gt;footer = $this-&gt;render('article/footer'); Commonly, you may want to alter the layout based on the current module . This requires (a) detecting if the controller matched in routing belongs to this module, and then (b) changing the template of the View Model. The place to do these actions is in a listener. It should listen either to the route event at low (negative) priority, or on the dispatch event, at any priority. Typically, you will register this during the bootstrap event. namespace Content; use Laminas\\Mvc\\MvcEvent; class Module { /** * @param MvcEvent $e The MvcEvent instance * @return void */ public function onBootstrap(MvcEvent $e) { // Register a dispatch event $app = $e-&gt;getParam('application'); $app-&gt;getEventManager()-&gt;attach('dispatch', [$this, 'setLayout']); } /** * @param MvcEvent $e The MvcEvent instance * @return void */ public function setLayout(MvcEvent $e) { $matches = $e-&gt;getRouteMatch(); $controller = $matches-&gt;getParam('controller'); if (false === strpos($controller, __NAMESPACE__)) { // not a controller from this module return; } // Set the layout template $viewModel = $e-&gt;getViewModel(); $viewModel-&gt;setTemplate('content/layout'); } } Creating and Registering Alternate Rendering and Response Strategies Laminas\\View\\View does very little. Its workflow is essentially to martial a ViewEvent , and then trigger two events, renderer and response . You can attach \"strategies\" to these events, using the methods addRenderingStrategy() and addResponseStrategy() , respectively. A Rendering Strategy introspects the Request object (or any other criteria) in order to select a Renderer (or fail to select one). A Response Strategy determines how to populate the Response based on the result of rendering. laminas-view ships with three Rendering and Response Strategies that you can use within your application. Laminas\\View\\Strategy\\PhpRendererStrategy . This strategy is a \"catch-all\" in that it will always return the Laminas\\View\\Renderer\\PhpRenderer and populate the Response body with the results of rendering. Laminas\\View\\Strategy\\JsonStrategy . This strategy will return the Laminas\\View\\Renderer\\JsonRenderer , and populate the Response body with the JSON value returned, as well as set a Content-Type header with a value of application/json . Laminas\\View\\Strategy\\FeedStrategy . This strategy will return the Laminas\\View\\Renderer\\FeedRenderer , setting the feed type to either \"rss\" or \"atom\", based on what was matched. Its Response strategy will populate the Response body with the generated feed, as well as set a Content-Type header with the appropriate value based on feed type. By default, only the PhpRendererStrategy is registered, meaning you will need to register the other Strategies yourself if you want to use them. Additionally, it means that you will likely want to register these at higher priority to ensure they match before the PhpRendererStrategy . As an example, let's register the JsonStrategy : namespace Application; use Laminas\\Mvc\\MvcEvent; class Module { /** * @param MvcEvent $e The MvcEvent instance * @return void */ public function onBootstrap(MvcEvent $e) { // Register a \"render\" event, at high priority (so it executes prior // to the view attempting to render) $app = $e-&gt;getApplication(); $app-&gt;getEventManager()-&gt;attach('render', [$this, 'registerJsonStrategy'], 100); } /** * @param MvcEvent $e The MvcEvent instance * @return void */ public function registerJsonStrategy(MvcEvent $e) { $app = $e-&gt;getTarget(); $locator = $app-&gt;getServiceManager(); $view = $locator-&gt;get('Laminas\\View\\View'); $jsonStrategy = $locator-&gt;get('ViewJsonStrategy'); // Attach strategy, which is a listener aggregate, at high priority $jsonStrategy-&gt;attach($view-&gt;getEventManager(), 100); } } The above will register the JsonStrategy with the \"render\" event, such that it executes prior to the PhpRendererStrategy , and thus ensure that a JSON payload is created when the controller returns a JsonModel . You could also use the module configuration to add the strategies: namespace Application; use Laminas\\ModuleManager\\Feature\\ConfigProviderInterface; class Module implements ConfigProviderInterface { /** * Returns configuration to merge with application configuration * * @return array */ public function getConfig() { return [ /* ... */ 'view_manager' =&gt; [ /* ... */ 'strategies' =&gt; [ 'ViewJsonStrategy', ], ], ]; } } What if you want this to happen only in specific modules, or specific controllers? One way is similar to the last example in the previous section on layouts , where we detailed changing the layout for a specific module: namespace Application; use Laminas\\Mvc\\MvcEvent; class Module { /** * @param MvcEvent $e The MvcEvent instance * @return void */ public function onBootstrap(MvcEvent $e) { // Register a render event $app = $e-&gt;getParam('application'); $app-&gt;getEventManager()-&gt;attach('render', [$this, 'registerJsonStrategy'], 100); } /** * @param MvcEvent $e The MvcEvent instance * @return void */ public function registerJsonStrategy(MvcEvent $e) { $matches = $e-&gt;getRouteMatch(); $controller = $matches-&gt;getParam('controller'); if (false === strpos($controller, __NAMESPACE__)) { // not a controller from this module return; } // Potentially, you could be even more selective at this point, and test // for specific controller classes, and even specific actions or request // methods. // Set the JSON strategy when controllers from this module are selected $app = $e-&gt;getTarget(); $locator = $app-&gt;getServiceManager(); $view = $locator-&gt;get('Laminas\\View\\View'); $jsonStrategy = $locator-&gt;get('ViewJsonStrategy'); // Attach strategy, which is a listener aggregate, at high priority $jsonStrategy-&gt;attach($view-&gt;getEventManager(), 100); } } While the above examples detail using the JsonStrategy , the same could be done for the FeedStrategy . If you successfully registered the Strategy you need to use the appropriate ViewModel : namespace Application; use Laminas\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController; use Laminas\\View\\Model\\ViewModel; use Laminas\\View\\Model\\JsonModel; use Laminas\\View\\Model\\FeedModel; class MyController extends AbstractActionController { /** * Lists the items as HTML */ public function listAction() { $items = /* ... get items ... */; $viewModel = new ViewModel(); $viewModel-&gt;setVariable('items', $items); return $viewModel; } /** * Lists the items as JSON */ public function listJsonAction() { $items = /* ... get items ... */; $viewModel = new JsonModel(); $viewModel-&gt;setVariable('items', $items); return $viewModel; } /** * Lists the items as a Feed */ public function listFeedAction() { $items = /* ... get items ... */; $viewModel = new FeedModel(); $viewModel-&gt;setVariable('items', $items); return $viewModel; } } Or you could switch the ViewModel dynamically based on the \"Accept\" HTTP Header with the Laminas-Mvc-Plugin AcceptableViewModelSelector .","title":"Quick Start"},{"location":"quick-start/#quick-start","text":"laminas-view provides the \"View\" layer of Laminas's MVC system. It is a multi-tiered system allowing a variety of mechanisms for extension, substitution, and more. The components of the view layer are as follows: Variables Containers hold variables and callbacks that you wish to represent in the view. Often-times, a Variables Container will also provide mechanisms for context-specific escaping of variables and more. View Models hold Variables Containers, specify the template to use (if any), and optionally provide rendering options (more on that below). View Models may be nested in order to represent complex structures. Renderers take View Models and provide a representation of them to return. laminas-view ships with three renderers by default: a PhpRenderer which utilizes PHP templates in order to generate markup, a JsonRenderer , and a FeedRenderer for generating RSS and Atom feeds. Resolvers utilize Resolver Strategies to resolve a template name to a resource a Renderer may consume. As an example, a Resolver may take the name \"blog/entry\" and resolve it to a PHP view script. The View consists of strategies that map the current Request to a Renderer, and strategies for injecting the result of rendering to the Response. Rendering Strategies listen to the Laminas\\View\\ViewEvent::EVENT_RENDERER event of the View and decide which Renderer should be selected based on the Request or other criteria. Response Strategies are used to inject the Response object with the results of rendering. That may also include taking actions such as setting Content-Type headers. Additionally, laminas-mvc integrates with laminas-view via a number of event listeners in the Laminas\\Mvc\\View namespace. This section of the manual is designed to show you typical usage patterns of the view layer when using it with laminas-mvc . The assumption is that you are using the service manager and the default MVC view strategies.","title":"Quick Start"},{"location":"quick-start/#configuration","text":"The default configuration will typically work out-of-the-box.

Where do you create these, though? The most explicit way is to create them in your controllers and return them. namespace Foo\\Controller; use Laminas\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController; use Laminas\\View\\Model\\ViewModel; class BazBatController extends AbstractActionController { public function doSomethingCrazyAction() { $view = new ViewModel([ 'message' =&gt; 'Hello world', ]); $view-&gt;setTemplate('foo/baz-bat/do-something-crazy'); return $view; } } This sets a \"message\" variable in the View Model, and sets the template name \"foo/baz-bat/do-something-crazy\". The View Model is then returned. In most cases, you'll likely have a template name based on the module namespace, controller, and action. Considering that, and if you're simply passing some variables, could this be made simpler? Definitely. The MVC registers a couple of listeners for controllers to automate this. The first will look to see if you returned an associative array from your controller; if so, it will create a View Model and make this associative array the Variables Container; this View Model then replaces the MvcEvent 's result. It will also look to see if you returned nothing or null ; if so, it will create a View Model without any variables attached; this View Model also replaces the MvcEvent 's result. The second listener checks to see if the MvcEvent result is a View Model, and, if so, if it has a template associated with it. If not, it will inspect the controller matched during routing to determine the module namespace and the controller class name, and, if available, it's \"action\" parameter in order to create a template name. This will be module/controller/action , all normalized to lowercase, dash-separated words. As an example, the controller Foo\\Controller\\BazBatController with action \"doSomethingCrazyAction\", would be mapped to the template foo/baz-bat/do-something-crazy . As you can see, the words \"Controller\" and \"Action\" are omitted. In practice, that means our previous example could be re-written as follows: namespace Foo\\Controller; use Laminas\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController; class BazBatController extends AbstractActionController { public function doSomethingCrazyAction() { return [ 'message' =&gt; 'Hello world', ]; } } The above method will likely work for the majority of use cases.

In other words, you might want to render templates to be included within the main View you return. As an example, you may want the View from an action to be one primary section that includes both an \"article\" and a couple of sidebars; one of the sidebars may include content from multiple Views as well: namespace Content\\Controller; use Laminas\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController; use Laminas\\View\\Model\\ViewModel; class ArticleController extends AbstractActionController { public function viewAction() { // get the article from the persistence layer, etc... $view = new ViewModel(); // this is not needed since it matches \"module/controller/action\" $view-&gt;setTemplate('content/article/view'); $articleView = new ViewModel(['article' =&gt; $article]); $articleView-&gt;setTemplate('content/article'); $primarySidebarView = new ViewModel(); $primarySidebarView-&gt;setTemplate('content/main-sidebar'); $secondarySidebarView = new ViewModel(); $secondarySidebarView-&gt;setTemplate('content/secondary-sidebar'); $sidebarBlockView = new ViewModel(); $sidebarBlockView-&gt;setTemplate('content/block'); $secondarySidebarView-&gt;addChild($sidebarBlockView, 'block'); $view-&gt;addChild($articleView, 'article') -&gt;addChild($primarySidebarView, 'sidebar_primary') -&gt;addChild($secondarySidebarView, 'sidebar_secondary'); return $view; } } The above will create and return a View Model specifying the template content/article/view . When the View is rendered, it will render three child Views, the $articleView , $primarySidebarView , and $secondarySidebarView ; these will be captured to the $view 's article , sidebar_primary , and sidebar_secondary variables, respectively, so that when it renders, you may include that content. Additionally, the $secondarySidebarView will include an additional View Model, $sidebarBlockView , which will be captured to its block view variable. To better visualize this, let's look at what the final content might look like, with comments detailing where each nested view model is injected. Here are the templates, rendered based on a 12-column grid.

As an example, let's register the JsonStrategy : namespace Application; use Laminas\\Mvc\\MvcEvent; class Module { /** * @param MvcEvent $e The MvcEvent instance * @return void */ public function onBootstrap(MvcEvent $e) { // Register a \"render\" event, at high priority (so it executes prior // to the view attempting to render) $app = $e-&gt;getApplication(); $app-&gt;getEventManager()-&gt;attach('render', [$this, 'registerJsonStrategy'], 100); } /** * @param MvcEvent $e The MvcEvent instance * @return void */ public function registerJsonStrategy(MvcEvent $e) { $app = $e-&gt;getTarget(); $locator = $app-&gt;getServiceManager(); $view = $locator-&gt;get('Laminas\\View\\View'); $jsonStrategy = $locator-&gt;get('ViewJsonStrategy'); // Attach strategy, which is a listener aggregate, at high priority $jsonStrategy-&gt;attach($view-&gt;getEventManager(), 100); } } The above will register the JsonStrategy with the \"render\" event, such that it executes prior to the PhpRendererStrategy , and thus ensure that a JSON payload is created when the controller returns a JsonModel . You could also use the module configuration to add the strategies: namespace Application; use Laminas\\ModuleManager\\Feature\\ConfigProviderInterface; class Module implements ConfigProviderInterface { /** * Returns configuration to merge with application configuration * * @return array */ public function getConfig() { return [ /* ... */ 'view_manager' =&gt; [ /* ... */ 'strategies' =&gt; [ 'ViewJsonStrategy', ], ], ]; } } What if you want this to happen only in specific modules, or specific controllers? One way is similar to the last example in the previous section on layouts , where we detailed changing the layout for a specific module: namespace Application; use Laminas\\Mvc\\MvcEvent; class Module { /** * @param MvcEvent $e The MvcEvent instance * @return void */ public function onBootstrap(MvcEvent $e) { // Register a render event $app = $e-&gt;getParam('application'); $app-&gt;getEventManager()-&gt;attach('render', [$this, 'registerJsonStrategy'], 100); } /** * @param MvcEvent $e The MvcEvent instance * @return void */ public function registerJsonStrategy(MvcEvent $e) { $matches = $e-&gt;getRouteMatch(); $controller = $matches-&gt;getParam('controller'); if (false === strpos($controller, __NAMESPACE__)) { // not a controller from this module return; } // Potentially, you could be even more selective at this point, and test // for specific controller classes, and even specific actions or request // methods. // Set the JSON strategy when controllers from this module are selected $app = $e-&gt;getTarget(); $locator = $app-&gt;getServiceManager(); $view = $locator-&gt;get('Laminas\\View\\View'); $jsonStrategy = $locator-&gt;get('ViewJsonStrategy'); // Attach strategy, which is a listener aggregate, at high priority $jsonStrategy-&gt;attach($view-&gt;getEventManager(), 100); } } While the above examples detail using the JsonStrategy , the same could be done for the FeedStrategy . If you successfully registered the Strategy you need to use the appropriate ViewModel : namespace Application; use Laminas\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController; use Laminas\\View\\Model\\ViewModel; use Laminas\\View\\Model\\JsonModel; use Laminas\\View\\Model\\FeedModel; class MyController extends AbstractActionController { /** * Lists the items as HTML */ public function listAction() { $items = /* ... get items ... */; $viewModel = new ViewModel(); $viewModel-&gt;setVariable('items', $items); return $viewModel; } /** * Lists the items as JSON */ public function listJsonAction() { $items = /* ... get items ... */; $viewModel = new JsonModel(); $viewModel-&gt;setVariable('items', $items); return $viewModel; } /** * Lists the items as a Feed */ public function listFeedAction() { $items = /* ... get items ... */; $viewModel = new FeedModel(); $viewModel-&gt;setVariable('items', $items); return $viewModel; } } Or you could switch the ViewModel dynamically based on the \"Accept\" HTTP Header with the Laminas-Mvc-Plugin AcceptableViewModelSelector .","title":"Creating and Registering Alternate Rendering and Response Strategies"},{"location":"view-event/","text":"The ViewEvent laminas-view incorporates and utilizes a custom laminas-eventmanager Event implementation, Laminas\\View\\ViewEvent .

HelperPluginManager is a specialized service manager, so you can register a helper/plugin like any other service (see the Service Manager documentation for more information). Programmatically, this is done as follows: use MyModule\\View\\Helper\\LowerCase; // $view is an instance of PhpRenderer $pluginManager = $view-&gt;getHelperPluginManager(); // Register an alias: $pluginManager-&gt;setAlias('lowercase', LowerCase::class); // Register a factory: $pluginManager-&gt;setFactory(LowerCase::class, function () { $lowercaseHelper = new LowerCase(); // ...do some configuration or dependency injection... return $lowercaseHelper; }); Within an MVC application, you will typically pass a map of plugins to the class via your configuration. use MyModule\\View\\Helper; use Laminas\\ServiceManager\\Factory\\InvokableFactory; // From within a configuration file return [ 'view_helpers' =&gt; [ 'aliases' =&gt; [ 'lowercase' =&gt; Helper\\LowerCase::class, 'uppercase' =&gt; Helper\\UpperCase::class, ], 'factories' =&gt; [ LowerCase::class =&gt; InvokableFactory::class, UpperCase::class =&gt; InvokableFactory::class, ], ], ]; If your module class implements Laminas\\ModuleManager\\Feature\\ViewHelperProviderInterface , or just the method getViewHelperConfig() , you could also do the following (it's the same as the previous example). namespace MyModule; class Module { public function getViewHelperConfig() { return [ 'aliases' =&gt; [ 'lowercase' =&gt; Helper\\LowerCase::class, 'uppercase' =&gt; Helper\\UpperCase::class, ], 'factories' =&gt; [ LowerCase::class =&gt; InvokableFactory::class, UpperCase::class =&gt; InvokableFactory::class, ], ]; } } The two latter examples can be done in each module that needs to register helpers with the PhpRenderer ; however, be aware that another module can register helpers with the same name, so order of modules can impact which helper class will actually be registered! Writing Custom Helpers Writing custom helpers is easy. We recommend extending Laminas\\View\\Helper\\AbstractHelper , but at the minimum, you need only implement the Laminas\\View\\Helper\\HelperInterface interface: namespace Laminas\\View\\Helper; use Laminas\\View\\Renderer\\RendererInterface as Renderer; interface HelperInterface { /** * Set the View object * * @param Renderer $view * @return HelperInterface */ public function setView(Renderer $view); /** * Get the View object * * @return Renderer */ public function getView(); } If you want your helper to be capable of being invoked as if it were a method call of the PhpRenderer , you should also implement an __invoke() method within your helper. As previously noted, we recommend extending Laminas\\View\\Helper\\AbstractHelper , as it implements the methods defined in HelperInterface , giving you a headstart in your development. Invokable helpers Starting with version 2.7.0, helpers no longer need to be instances of HelperInterface , but can be any PHP callable. We recommend writing helpers as invokable classes (classes implementing __invoke() . Once you have defined your helper class, make sure you can autoload it, and then register it with the plugin manager . Here is an example helper, which we're titling \"SpecialPurpose\" namespace MyModule\\View\\Helper; use Laminas\\View\\Helper\\AbstractHelper; class SpecialPurpose extends AbstractHelper { protected $count = 0; public function __invoke() { $this-&gt;count++; $output = sprintf(\"I have seen 'The Jerk' %d time(s).\", $this-&gt;count); return htmlspecialchars($output, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8'); } } Then assume that we register it with the plugin manager by the name \"specialPurpose\". Within a view script, you can call the SpecialPurpose helper as many times as you like; it will be instantiated once, and then it persists for the life of that PhpRenderer instance. // remember, in a view script, $this refers to the Laminas\\View\\Renderer\\PhpRenderer instance. echo $this-&gt;specialPurpose(); echo $this-&gt;specialPurpose(); echo $this-&gt;specialPurpose(); The output would look something like this: I have seen 'The Jerk' 1 time(s). I have seen 'The Jerk' 2 time(s). I have seen 'The Jerk' 3 time(s). Sometimes you will need access to the calling PhpRenderer object; for instance, if you need to use the registered encoding, or want to render another view script as part of your helper. This is why we define the setView() and getView() methods. As an example, we could rewrite the SpecialPurpose helper as follows to take advantage of the EscapeHtml helper: namespace MyModule\\View\\Helper; use Laminas\\View\\Helper\\AbstractHelper; class SpecialPurpose extends AbstractHelper { protected $count = 0; public function __invoke() { $this-&gt;count++; $output = sprintf(\"I have seen 'The Jerk' %d time(s).\", $this-&gt;count); $escaper = $this-&gt;getView()-&gt;plugin('escapehtml'); return $escaper($output); } } Accessing the view or other helpers in callables As noted earlier, starting in version 2.7.0, you may use any PHP callable as a helper. If you do, however, how can you access the renderer or other plugins? The answer is: dependency injection. If you write your helper as a class, you can accept dependencies via the constructor or other setter methods. Create a factory that pulls those dependencies and injects them. As an example, if we need the escapeHtml() helper, we could write our helper as follows: namespace MyModule\\View\\Helper; use Laminas\\View\\Helper\\EscapeHtml; class SpecialPurpose { private $count = 0; private $escaper; public function __construct(EscapeHtml $escaper) { $this-&gt;escaper = $escaper; } public function __invoke() { $this-&gt;count++; $output = sprintf(\"I have seen 'The Jerk' %d time(s).\", $this-&gt;count); $escaper = $this-&gt;escaper; return $escaper($output); } } Then we would write a factory like the following: use Laminas\\ServiceManager\\AbstractPluginManager; class SpecialPurposeFactory { public function __invoke($container) { if (! $container instanceof AbstractPluginManager) { // laminas-servicemanager v3. v2 passes the helper manager directly. $container = $container-&gt;get('ViewHelperManager'); } return new SpecialPurpose($container-&gt;get('escapeHtml')); } } If access to the view were required, we'd pass the PhpRenderer service instead. Registering Concrete Helpers Sometimes it is convenient to instantiate a view helper, and then register it with the renderer. This can be done by injecting it directly into the plugin manager. // $view is a PhpRenderer instance $helper = new MyModule\\View\\Helper\\LowerCase; // ...do some configuration or dependency injection... $view-&gt;getHelperPluginManager()-&gt;setService('lowercase', $helper); The plugin manager will validate the helper/plugin, and if the validation passes, the helper/plugin will be registered.","title":"Advanced usage of helpers"},{"location":"helpers/advanced-usage/#advanced-usage-of-helpers","text":"","title":"Advanced usage of helpers"},{"location":"helpers/advanced-usage/#registering-helpers","text":"Laminas\\View\\Renderer\\PhpRenderer composes a plugin manager for managing helpers, specifically an instance of Laminas\\View\\HelperPluginManager , which extends Laminas\\ServiceManager\\AbstractPluginManager , which is itself an extension of Laminas\\ServiceManager\\ServiceManager .

Using Recursion All escape helpers can use recursion for the given values during the escape operation. This allows the escaping of the datatypes array and object . Escape an Array To escape an array , the second parameter $recurse must be use the constant RECURSE_ARRAY of an escape helper: $html = [ 'headline' =&gt; '&lt;h1&gt;Foo&lt;/h1&gt;', 'content' =&gt; [ 'paragraph' =&gt; '&lt;p&gt;Bar&lt;/p&gt;', ], ]; var_dump($this-&gt;escapeHtml($html, Laminas\\View\\Helper\\EscapeHtml::RECURSE_ARRAY)); Output: array(2) { 'headline' =&gt; string(24) \"&lt;h1&gt;Foo&lt;/h1&gt;\" 'content' =&gt; array(1) { 'paragraph' =&gt; string(22) \"&lt;p&gt;Bar&lt;/p&gt;\" } } Escape an Object An escape helper can use the __toString() method of an object. No additional parameter is needed: $object = new class { public function __toString() : string { return '&lt;h1&gt;Foo&lt;/h1&gt;'; } }; echo $this-&gt;escapeHtml($object); // \"&lt;h1&gt;Foo&lt;/h1&gt;\" An escape helper can also use the toArray() method of an object.

Additionally, the HeadLink helper has special methods for adding 'alternate' links to its stack: appendAlternate($href, $type, $title, $extras = []) offsetSetAlternate($index, $href, $type, $title, $extras = []) prependAlternate($href, $type, $title, $extras = []) setAlternate($href, $type, $title, $extras = []) The headLink() helper method allows specifying all attributes necessary for a &lt;link&gt; element, and allows you to also specify placement: whether the new element replaces all others, prepends (top of stack), or appends (end of stack). The HeadLink helper is a concrete implementation of the Placeholder helper .","title":"HeadLink"},{"location":"helpers/head-link/#basic-usage","text":"You may specify a headLink at any time. Typically, you will specify global links in your layout script, and application specific links in your application view scripts.

The HeadMeta helper supports the following methods for setting and adding meta tags: appendName($keyValue, $content, $conditionalName) offsetSetName($index, $keyValue, $content, $conditionalName) prependName($keyValue, $content, $conditionalName) setName($keyValue, $content, $modifiers) appendHttpEquiv($keyValue, $content, $conditionalHttpEquiv) offsetSetHttpEquiv($index, $keyValue, $content, $conditionalHttpEquiv) prependHttpEquiv($keyValue, $content, $conditionalHttpEquiv) setHttpEquiv($keyValue, $content, $modifiers) setCharset($charset) The following methods are also supported with XHTML1_RDFA doctype set with the Doctype helper . appendProperty($property, $content, $modifiers) offsetSetProperty($index, $property, $content, $modifiers) prependProperty($property, $content, $modifiers) setProperty($property, $content, $modifiers) Finally, starting in 2.11.2, you can call the following method to determine whether or not to autoescape values used in meta tags: setAutoEscape(bool $autoEscape = true) (enabled by default) AutoEscape Disable this flag at your own risk. The one documented case where it is necessary to disable the flag is when setting the X-UA-Compatible http-equiv value to switch behavior for Internet Explorer, as escaped values will not trigger correct representation. The $keyValue item is used to define a value for the name or http-equiv key; $content is the value for the 'content' key, and $modifiers is an optional associative array that can contain keys for lang and/or scheme . You may also set meta tags using the headMeta() helper method, which has the following signature: headMeta($content, $keyValue, $keyType = 'name', $modifiers = [], $placement = 'APPEND') . $keyValue is the content for the key specified in $keyType , which should be either name or http-equiv . $keyType may also be specified as property if the doctype has been set to XHTML1_RDFA . $placement can be SET (overwrites all previously stored values), APPEND (added to end of stack), or PREPEND (added to top of stack). HeadMeta overrides each of append() , offsetSet() , prepend() , and set() to enforce usage of the special methods as listed above. Internally, it stores each item as a stdClass token, which it later serializes using the itemToString() method. This allows you to perform checks on the items in the stack, and optionally modify these items by simply modifying the object returned. The HeadMeta helper is a concrete implementation of the Placeholder helper . Basic Usage You may specify a new meta tag at any time. Typically, you will specify client-side caching rules or SEO keywords. For instance, if you wish to specify SEO keywords, you'd be creating a meta name tag with the name keywords and the content the keywords you wish to associate with your page: // setting meta keywords $this-&gt;headMeta()-&gt;appendName('keywords', 'framework, PHP, productivity'); If you wished to set some client-side caching rules, you'd set http-equiv tags with the rules you wish to enforce: // disabling client-side cache $this-&gt;headMeta() -&gt;appendHttpEquiv('expires', 'Wed, 26 Feb 1997 08:21:57 GMT') -&gt;appendHttpEquiv('pragma', 'no-cache') -&gt;appendHttpEquiv('Cache-Control', 'no-cache'); Another popular use for meta tags is setting the content type, character set, and language: // setting content type and character set $this-&gt;headMeta() -&gt;appendHttpEquiv('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=UTF-8') -&gt;appendHttpEquiv('Content-Language', 'en-US'); If you are serving an HTML5 document, you should provide the character set like this: // setting character set in HTML5 $this-&gt;headMeta()-&gt;setCharset('UTF-8'); // Will look like &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt; As a final example, an easy way to display a transitional message before a redirect is using a \"meta refresh\": // setting a meta refresh for 3 seconds to a new url: $this-&gt;headMeta() -&gt;appendHttpEquiv('Refresh', '3;URL=http://www.some.org/some.html'); When you're ready to place your meta tags in the layout, echo the helper: &lt;?= $this-&gt;headMeta() ?&gt; Usage with XHTML1_RDFA doctype Enabling the RDFa doctype with the Doctype helper enables the use of the property attribute (in addition to the standard name and http-equiv ) with HeadMeta .

For the *Script() methods, $script is the client-side scripting directives you wish to use in the element. Setting Conditional Comments HeadScript allows you to wrap the script tag in conditional comments, which allows you to hide it from specific browsers. To add the conditional tags, pass the conditional value as part of the $attrs parameter in the method calls. // adding scripts $this-&gt;headScript()-&gt;appendFile( '/js/prototype.js', 'text/javascript', ['conditional' =&gt; 'lt IE 7'] ); Preventing HTML style comments or CDATA wrapping of scripts By default, HeadScript will wrap scripts with HTML comments or it wraps scripts with XHTML CDATA. This behavior can be problematic when you intend to use the script tag in an alternative way by setting the type to something other then text/javascript . To prevent such escaping, pass an noescape with a value of true as part of the $attrs parameter in the method calls. // jquery template $template = '&lt;div class=\"book\"&gt;{{:title}}&lt;/div&gt;'; $this-&gt;headScript()-&gt;appendScript( $template, 'text/x-jquery-tmpl', ['id' =&gt; 'tmpl-book', 'noescape' =&gt; true] ); HeadScript also allows capturing scripts; this can be useful if you want to create the client-side script programmatically, and then place it elsewhere.

Use InlineScript for HTML Body Scripts HeadScript 's sibling helper, InlineScript , should be used when you wish to include scripts inline in the HTML body . Placing scripts at the end of your document is a good practice for speeding up delivery of your page, particularly when using 3rd party analytics scripts. Arbitrary Attributes are Disabled by Default By default, HeadScript only will render &lt;script&gt; attributes that are blessed by the W3C. These include id , charset , crossorigin , defer , integrity , language , src , and type . However, some JavaScript frameworks, notably Dojo , utilize custom attributes in order to modify behavior.

If you want to use another encoding with headStyle , you must: Create a custom renderer and implement a getEncoding() method; Create a custom rendering strategy that will return an instance of your custom renderer; Attach the custom strategy in the ViewEvent . First we have to write the custom renderer: // module/MyModule/View/Renderer/MyRenderer.php namespace MyModule\\View\\Renderer; // Since we just want to implement the getEncoding() method, we can extend the Laminas native renderer use Laminas\\View\\Renderer\\PhpRenderer; class MyRenderer extends PhpRenderer { /** * @var string */ protected $encoding; /** * Constructor * * @param string $encoding The encoding to be used */ public function __construct($encoding) { parent::__construct(); $this-&gt;encoding = $encoding; } /** * Sets the encoding * * @param string $encoding The encoding to be used */ public function setEncoding($encoding) { $this-&gt;encoding = $encoding; } /** * Gets the encoding * * @return string The encoding being used */ public function getEncoding() { return $this-&gt;encoding; } } Now we make some configuration in the module class: // module/MyModule.php namespace MyModule; use MyModule\\View\\Renderer\\MyRenderer; use Laminas\\Mvc\\MvcEvent; use Laminas\\View\\Strategy\\PhpRendererStrategy; class Module { public function getConfig(){/* ... */} public function getAutoloaderConfig(){/* ... */} public function getServiceConfig() { return [ 'factories' =&gt; [ // Register our custom renderer in the container 'MyCustomRenderer' =&gt; function ($container) { return new MyRenderer('ISO-8859-1'); }, 'MyCustomStrategy' =&gt; function ($container) { // As stated before, we just want to implement the // getEncoding() method, so we can use the base PhpRendererStrategy // and provide our custom renderer to it. $myRenderer = $container-&gt;get('MyCustomRenderer'); return new PhpRendererStrategy($myRenderer); }, ], ]; } public function onBootstrap(MvcEvent $e) { // Register a render event $app = $e-&gt;getParam('application'); $app-&gt;getEventManager()-&gt;attach('render', [$this, 'registerMyStrategy'], 100); } public function registerMyStrategy(MvcEvent $e) { $app = $e-&gt;getTarget(); $locator = $app-&gt;getServiceManager(); $view = $locator-&gt;get('Laminas\\View\\View'); $myStrategy = $locator-&gt;get('MyCustomStrategy'); // Attach strategy, which is a listener aggregate, at high priority $view-&gt;getEventManager()-&gt;attach($myStrategy, 100); } } See the quick start Creating and Registering Alternate Rendering and Response Strategies chapter for more information on how to create and register custom strategies to your view.

The HeadTitle helper allows you to programmatically create and store the title for later retrieval and output. The HeadTitle helper is a concrete implementation of the Placeholder helper . It overrides the toString() method to enforce generating a &lt;title&gt; element, and adds a headTitle() method for overwriting and aggregation of title elements. The signature for that method is headTitle($title, $setType = null) ; by default, the value is appended to the stack (aggregating title segments) if left at null , but you may also specify either 'PREPEND' (place at top of stack) or 'SET' (overwrite stack). Since setting the aggregating (attach) order on each call to headTitle can be cumbersome, you can set a default attach order by calling setDefaultAttachOrder() which is applied to all headTitle() calls unless you explicitly pass a different attach order as the second parameter.

Add the name and set a separator in the layout script, e.g. module/Application/view/layout/layout.phtml &lt;?= $this-&gt;headTitle('Music')-&gt;setSeparator(' - ') ?&gt; Output: &lt;title&gt;My albums - Music&lt;/title&gt; Set Content The normal behaviour is to append the content to the title (container). $this-&gt;headTitle('My albums') $this-&gt;headTitle('Music'); echo $this-&gt;headTitle(); // &lt;title&gt;My albumsMusic&lt;/title&gt; Append Content To explicitly append content, the second paramater $setType or the concrete method append() of the helper can be used: Invoke Usage $this-&gt;headTitle('My albums') $this-&gt;headTitle('Music', 'APPEND'); echo $this-&gt;headTitle(); // &lt;title&gt;My albumsMusic&lt;/title&gt; Setter Usage $this-&gt;headTitle('My albums') $this-&gt;headTitle()-&gt;append('Music'); echo $this-&gt;headTitle(); // &lt;title&gt;My albumsMusic&lt;/title&gt; The constant Laminas\\View\\Helper\\Placeholder\\Container\\AbstractContainer::APPEND can also be used as value for the second parameter $setType . Prepend Content To prepend content, the second paramater $setType or the concrete method prepend() of the helper can be used: Invoke Usage $this-&gt;headTitle('My albums') $this-&gt;headTitle('Music', 'PREPEND'); echo $this-&gt;headTitle(); // &lt;title&gt;MusicMy albums&lt;/title&gt; Setter Usage $this-&gt;headTitle('My albums') $this-&gt;headTitle()-&gt;prepend('Music'); echo $this-&gt;headTitle(); // &lt;title&gt;MusicMy albums&lt;/title&gt; The constant Laminas\\View\\Helper\\Placeholder\\Container\\AbstractContainer::PREPEND can also be used as value for the second parameter $setType .

You can use helper, or plugin, classes to perform these behaviors for you. A helper is a class that implements Laminas\\View\\Helper\\HelperInterface , which defines two methods, setView() , which accepts a Laminas\\View\\Renderer\\RendererInterface instance/implementation, and getView() , used to retrieve that instance. Laminas\\View\\Renderer\\PhpRenderer composes a plugin manager , allowing you to retrieve helpers, and also provides some method overloading capabilities that allow proxying method calls to helpers. Callable Helpers Starting in version 2.7.0, if your helper does not need access to the view, you can also use any PHP callable as a helper, including arbitrary objects that implement __invoke() . As an example, let's say we have a helper class named MyModule\\View\\Helper\\LowerCase , which we register in our plugin manager with the name lowercase . We can retrieve it in one of the following ways: // $view is a PhpRenderer instance // Via the plugin manager: $pluginManager = $view-&gt;getHelperPluginManager(); $helper = $pluginManager-&gt;get('lowercase'); // Retrieve the helper instance, via the method \"plugin\", // which proxies to the plugin manager: $helper = $view-&gt;plugin('lowercase'); // If the helper does not define __invoke(), the following also retrieves it: $helper = $view-&gt;lowercase(); // If the helper DOES define __invoke, you can call the helper // as if it is a method: $filtered = $view-&gt;lowercase('some value'); The last two examples demonstrate how the PhpRenderer uses method overloading to retrieve and/or invoke helpers directly, offering a convenience API for end users. A large number of helpers are provided by default with laminas-view. You can also register helpers by adding them to the plugin manager. Included Helpers Laminas comes with an initial set of helper classes. In particular, there are helpers for creating route-based URLs and HTML lists, as well as declaring variables.

The primary use is for reusable template fragments with which you do not need to worry about variable name clashes. A sibling to the Partial , the PartialLoop view helper allows you to pass iterable data, and render a partial for each item. PartialLoop Counter The PartialLoop view helper gives access to the current position of the array within the view script via $this-&gt;partialLoop()-&gt;getPartialCounter() . This provides a way to have alternating colors on table rows, for example. Basic Usage Basic usage of partials is to render a template fragment in its own view scope. Consider the following partial script: &lt;?php // partial.phtml ?&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;From: &lt;?= $this-&gt;escapeHtml($this-&gt;from) ?&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Subject: &lt;?= $this-&gt;escapeHtml($this-&gt;subject) ?&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; You would then call it from your view script using the following: &lt;?= $this-&gt;partial('partial.phtml', [ 'from' =&gt; 'Team Framework', 'subject' =&gt; 'view partials', ]); ?&gt; Which would then render: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;From: Team Framework&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Subject: view partials&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; What is a model? A model used with the Partial view helper can be one of the following: array : If an array is passed, it should be associative, as its key/value pairs are assigned to &gt; the view with keys as view variables. Object implementing toArray( ) method . If an object is passed an has a toArray() method, the results of toArray() will be assigned to the view object as view variables. Standard object . Any other object will assign the results of get_object_vars() (essentially all public properties of the object) to the view object. If your model is an object, you may want to have it passed as an object to the partial script, instead of serializing it to an array of variables. You can do this by setting the objectKey property of the appropriate helper: // Tell partial to pass objects as 'model' variable $view-&gt;partial()-&gt;setObjectKey('model'); // Tell partial to pass objects from partialLoop as 'model' variable // in final partial view script: $view-&gt;partialLoop()-&gt;setObjectKey('model'); This technique is particularly useful when passing Laminas\\Db\\ResultSet\\ResultSet s to partialLoop() , as you then have full access to your row objects within the view scripts, allowing you to call methods on them (such as retrieving values from parent or dependent rows). Using PartialLoop to Render Iterable Models Typically, you'll want to use partials in a loop, to render the same content fragment many times; this way you can put large blocks of repeated content or complex display logic into a single location. However this has a performance impact, as the partial helper needs to be invoked once for each iteration. The PartialLoop view helper helps solve this issue. It allows you to pass an iterable item (array or object implementing Iterator ) as the model. It then iterates over this, passing, the items to the partial script as the model. Items in the iterator may be any model the Partial view helper allows. Let's assume the following partial view script: &lt;?php // partialLoop.phtml ?&gt; &lt;dt&gt;&lt;?= $this-&gt;key ?&gt;&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;&lt;?= $this-&gt;value ?&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; And the following \"model\": $model = [ ['key' =&gt; 'Mammal', 'value' =&gt; 'Camel'], ['key' =&gt; 'Bird', 'value' =&gt; 'Penguin'], ['key' =&gt; 'Reptile', 'value' =&gt; 'Asp'], ['key' =&gt; 'Fish', 'value' =&gt; 'Flounder'], ]; In your view script, you could then invoke the PartialLoop helper: &lt;dl&gt; &lt;?= $this-&gt;partialLoop('partialLoop.phtml', $model) ?&gt; &lt;/dl&gt; Resulting in the following: &lt;dl&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Mammal&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;Camel&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Bird&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;Penguin&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Reptile&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;Asp&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;dt&gt;Fish&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;Flounder&lt;/dd&gt; &lt;/dl&gt;","title":"Partial"},{"location":"helpers/partial/#partial","text":"The Partial view helper is used to render a specified template within its own variable scope.

It also offers some useful features such as aggregating content, capturing view script content for later use, and adding pre- and post-text to content (and custom separators for aggregated content). Basic Usage Basic usage of placeholders is to persist view data. Each invocation of the Placeholder helper expects a placeholder name; the helper then returns a placeholder container object that you can either manipulate or echo. &lt;?php $this-&gt;placeholder('foo')-&gt;set(\"Some text for later\") ?&gt; &lt;?= $this-&gt;placeholder('foo'); ?&gt; Results in: Some text for later Aggregate Content Aggregating content via placeholders can be useful at times as well. For instance, your view script may have a variable array from which you wish to retrieve messages to display later; a later view script can then determine how those will be rendered. The Placeholder view helper uses containers that extend ArrayObject , providing a rich feature set for manipulating arrays. In addition, it offers a variety of methods for formatting the content stored in the container: setPrefix($prefix) sets text with which to prefix the content. Use getPrefix() at any time to determine what the current setting is. setPostfix($prefix) sets text with which to append the content. Use getPostfix() at any time to determine what the current setting is. setSeparator($prefix) sets text with which to separate aggregated content. Use getSeparator() at any time to determine what the current setting is. setIndent($prefix) can be used to set an indentation value for content. If an integer is passed, that number of spaces will be used; if a string is passed, the string will be used. Use getIndent() at any time to determine what the current setting is. Set the data in one view script: &lt;!-- first view script --&gt; &lt;?php $this-&gt;placeholder('foo')-&gt;exchangeArray($this-&gt;data) ?&gt; And retrieve the data and output it in another view script: &lt;!-- later view script --&gt; &lt;?php $this-&gt;placeholder('foo') -&gt;setPrefix(\"&lt;ul&gt;\\n &lt;li&gt;\") -&gt;setSeparator(\"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;\\n\") -&gt;setIndent(4) -&gt;setPostfix(\"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\"); ?&gt; &lt;?= $this-&gt;placeholder('foo') ?&gt; The above results in an unordered list with pretty indentation. Because the Placeholder container objects extend ArrayObject , you can also assign content to a specific key in the container easily, instead of simply pushing it into the container. Keys may be accessed either as object properties or as array keys. &lt;?php $this-&gt;placeholder('foo')-&gt;bar = $this-&gt;data ?&gt; &lt;?= $this-&gt;placeholder('foo')-&gt;bar ?&gt; &lt;?php $foo = $this-&gt;placeholder('foo'); echo $foo['bar']; Capture Content Occasionally you may have content for a placeholder in a view script that is easiest to template; the Placeholder view helper allows you to capture arbitrary content for later rendering using the following API. captureStart($type, $key) begins capturing content. $type should be one of the Placeholder constants APPEND or SET . If APPEND , captured content is appended to the list of current content in the placeholder; if SET , captured content is used as the sole value of the placeholder (potentially replacing any previous content). By default, $type is APPEND . $key can be used to specify a specific key in the placeholder container to which you want content captured. captureStart() locks capturing until captureEnd() is called; you cannot nest capturing with the same placeholder container. Doing so will raise an exception. captureEnd() stops capturing content, and places it in the container object according to how captureStart() was called. As an example: &lt;!-- Default capture: append --&gt; &lt;?php $this-&gt;placeholder('foo')-&gt;captureStart(); foreach ($this-&gt;data as $datum): ?&gt; &lt;div class=\"foo\"&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;?= $datum-&gt;title ?&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;?= $datum-&gt;content ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt; &lt;?php $this-&gt;placeholder('foo')-&gt;captureEnd() ?&gt; &lt;?= $this-&gt;placeholder('foo') ?&gt; Alternately, capture to a key: &lt;!-- Capture to key --&gt; &lt;?php $this-&gt;placeholder('foo')-&gt;captureStart('SET', 'data'); foreach ($this-&gt;data as $datum): ?&gt; &lt;div class=\"foo\"&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;?= $datum-&gt;title ?&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;?= $datum-&gt;content ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt; &lt;?php $this-&gt;placeholder('foo')-&gt;captureEnd() ?&gt; &lt;?= $this-&gt;placeholder('foo')-&gt;data ?&gt; Clearing Content In certain situations it is desirable to remove or clear containers and aggregated content. The placeholder view helper provides two methods to either delete a specific container or clear all containers at once: Delete a single container $this-&gt;plugin('placeholder')-&gt;deleteContainer('myNamedContainer'); Clear all containers $this-&gt;plugin('placeholder')-&gt;clearContainers(); Concrete Implementations laminas-view ships with a number of \"concrete\" placeholder implementations. These are for commonly used placeholders: doctype, page title, and various &lt;head&gt; elements. In all cases, calling the placeholder with no arguments returns the element itself.

As an example: &lt;!-- Default capture: append --&gt; &lt;?php $this-&gt;placeholder('foo')-&gt;captureStart(); foreach ($this-&gt;data as $datum): ?&gt; &lt;div class=\"foo\"&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;?= $datum-&gt;title ?&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;?= $datum-&gt;content ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt; &lt;?php $this-&gt;placeholder('foo')-&gt;captureEnd() ?&gt; &lt;?= $this-&gt;placeholder('foo') ?&gt; Alternately, capture to a key: &lt;!-- Capture to key --&gt; &lt;?php $this-&gt;placeholder('foo')-&gt;captureStart('SET', 'data'); foreach ($this-&gt;data as $datum): ?&gt; &lt;div class=\"foo\"&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;?= $datum-&gt;title ?&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;?= $datum-&gt;content ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;?php endforeach; ?&gt; &lt;?php $this-&gt;placeholder('foo')-&gt;captureEnd() ?&gt; &lt;?= $this-&gt;placeholder('foo')-&gt;data ?&gt;","title":"Capture Content"},{"location":"helpers/placeholder/#clearing-content","text":"In certain situations it is desirable to remove or clear containers and aggregated content.

The syntax for the view helper is $this-&gt;url($name, $params, $options, $reuseMatchedParameters) , using the following definitions for the helper arguments: $name : The name of the route you want to output. $params : An array of parameters that is defined within the respective route configuration. $options : An array of options that will be used to create the URL. $reuseMatchedParams : A flag indicating if the currently matched route parameters should be used when generating the new URL. Let's take a look at how this view helper is used in real-world applications. Basic Usage The following example shows a simple configuration for a news module. The route is called news and it has two optional parameters called action and id . // In a configuration array (e.g. returned by some module's module.config.php) 'router' =&gt; [ 'routes' =&gt; [ 'news' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'segment', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; '/news[/:action][/:id]', 'constraints' =&gt; [ 'action' =&gt; '[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*', ], 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; 'news', 'action' =&gt; 'index', ], ], ], ], ], First, let's use the view helper to create the output for the URL /news without any of the optional parameters being used: &lt;a href=\"&lt;?= $this-&gt;url('news'); ?&gt;\"&gt;News Index&lt;/a&gt; This will render the output: &lt;a href=\"/news\"&gt;News Index&lt;/a&gt; Now let's assume we want to get a link to display the detail page of a single news entry. For this task, the optional parameters action and id need to have values assigned. This is how you do that: &lt;a href=\"&lt;?= $this-&gt;url('news', ['action' =&gt; 'details', 'id' =&gt; 42]); ?&gt;\"&gt; Details of News #42 &lt;/a&gt; This will render the output: &lt;a href=\"/news/details/42\"&gt;News Index&lt;/a&gt; Query String Arguments Most SEO experts agree that pagination parameters should not be part of the URL path; for example, the following URL would be considered a bad practice: /news/archive/page/13 . Pagination is more correctly accomplished using a query string arguments, such as /news/archive?page=13 . To achieve this, you'll need to make use of the $options argument from the view helper. We will use the same route configuration as defined above: // In a configuration array (e.g. returned by some module's module.config.php) 'router' =&gt; [ 'routes' =&gt; [ 'news' =&gt; [ 'type' =&gt; 'segment', 'options' =&gt; [ 'route' =&gt; '/news[/:action][/:id]', 'constraints' =&gt; [ 'action' =&gt; '[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*', ], 'defaults' =&gt; [ 'controller' =&gt; 'news', 'action' =&gt; 'index', ], ], ], ], ], To generate query string arguments from the view helper, you need to assign them as the third argument using the query key like this: &lt;?php $url = $this-&gt;url( 'news', ['action' =&gt; 'archive'], [ 'query' =&gt; [ 'page' =&gt; 13, ], ] ); ?&gt; &lt;a href=\"&lt;?= $url; ?&gt;\"&gt;News Archive Page #13&lt;/a&gt; The above code sample would output: &lt;a href=\"/news/archive?page=13\"&gt;News Archive Page #13&lt;/a&gt; Fragments Another possible entry within the $options array is the assignment of URL fragments (typically used to link to in-page anchors), denoted with using the fragment key. Let's assume we want to enter a link for users to directly jump to the comment section of a details page: &lt;?php $url = $this-&gt;url( 'news', ['action' =&gt; 'details', 'id' =&gt; 42], [ 'fragment' =&gt; 'comments', ] ); ?&gt; &lt;a href=\"&lt;?= $url; ?&gt;\"&gt;Comment Section of News #42&lt;/a&gt; The above code sample would output: &lt;a href=\"/news/details/42#comments\"&gt;Comment Section of News #42&lt;/a&gt; You can use fragment and query options at the same time! &lt;?php $url = $this-&gt;url( 'news', ['action' =&gt; 'details', 'id' =&gt; 42], [ 'query' =&gt; [ 'commentPage' =&gt; 3, ], 'fragment' =&gt; 'comments', ] ); ?&gt; &lt;a href=\"&lt;?= $url; ?&gt;\"&gt;Comment Section of News #42&lt;/a&gt; The above code sample would output: &lt;a href=\"/news/details/42?commentPage=3#comments\"&gt;Comment Section of News #42&lt;/a&gt; Fully Qualified Domain Name Another possible entry within the $options array is to output a fully qualified domain name (absolute URL), denoted using the force_canonical key: &lt;?php $url = $this-&gt;url( 'news', [], [ 'force_canonical' =&gt; true, ] ); ?&gt; &lt;a href=\"&lt;?= $url; ?&gt;\"&gt;News Index&lt;/a&gt; The above code sample would output: &lt;a href=\"http://www.example.com/news\"&gt;News Index&lt;/a&gt; Reusing Matched Parameters When you're on a route that has many parameters, often times it makes sense to reuse currently matched parameters instead of assigning them explicitly. In this case, the argument $reuseMatchedParams will come in handy. As an example, we will imagine being on a detail page for our news route. We want to display links to the edit and delete actions without having to assign the ID again: // Currently url /news/details/777 &lt;a href=\"&lt;?= $this-&gt;url('news', ['action' =&gt; 'edit'], null, true); ?&gt;\"&gt;Edit Me&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"&lt;?= $this-&gt;url('news', ['action' =&gt; 'delete'], null, true); ?&gt;\"&gt;Delete Me&lt;/a&gt; Notice the true argument in the fourth position. This tells the view helper to use the matched id ( 777 ) when creating the new URL: &lt;a href=\"/news/edit/777\"&gt;Edit Me&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"/news/delete/777\"&gt;Edit Me&lt;/a&gt; Shorthand Due to the fact that reusing parameters is a use case that can happen when no route options are set, the third argument for the URL view helper will be checked against its type; when a boolean is passed, the helper uses it to set the value of the $reuseMatchedParams flag: $this-&gt;url('news', ['action' =&gt; 'archive'], null, true); // is equal to $this-&gt;url('news', ['action' =&gt; 'archive'], true);","title":"Url"},{"location":"helpers/url/#url","text":"The URL view helper is used to create a string representation of the routes that you define within your application.
